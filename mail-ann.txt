Subject: [ANNOUNCE] wxPerl 0.13

A new version of wxPerl, the Perl bindings to wxWindows, is out!

You can download the source from CPAN.

Binary packages for ActivePerl/Win32 6xx and 9xx builds, and Red Hat
Linux are available along with documentation in HTML and MS HTML Help
format from http://wxperl.sourceforge.net/

Changes since the last version:
	- new DEPRECATIONS section in README.txt, please read it
	- New build system, allows building wxPerl extension written using
	  XS outside of the wxPerl tree.
	- Added Wx::Wave
	- Added Wx::MemoryFSHandler
	- Added Wx::Perl::Carp (thanks to podmaster).
	- Mac OS X support (requires wxWindows 2.4.0 or newer).
	- Added Wx::Socket* (thanks to Graciliano M. P.)

Mattia
