Subject: [ANNOUNCE] wxPerl 0.14

A new version of wxPerl, the Perl bindings to wxWindows, is out!

You can download the source from CPAN.

Binary packages for ActivePerl/Win32 6xx and 8xx builds, and Red Hat
Linux are available along with documentation in HTML and MS HTML Help
format from http://wxperl.sourceforge.net/

Changes since the last version:
	- new DEPRECATIONS section in README.txt, please read it
	- Added Wx::CalendarCtrl.
	- Added Wx::DateTime (not the full interface).
	- Restored compatibility with perl 5.005.
	- Internal changes: objects returned by various constructors
          will not have an additional _WXTHIS key anymore.

Regards
Mattia
