Subject: [ANNOUNCE] wxPerl 0.18

A new version of wxPerl, the Perl bindings to wxWindows, is out!

You can download the sources from CPAN.

Linux are available along with documentation in HTML and MS HTML Help

Changes since the last release:
	- Corrected handling of UTF-8 encoded strings in ANSI builds.
