Subject: [ANNOUNCE] wxPerl 0.18

A new version of wxPerl, the Perl bindings to wxWindows, is out!

wxWindows is a free and cross platform (Windows/Motif/GTK/Mac) C++ GUI
toolkit with native look and feel.  (visit http://www.wxwindows.org/
for details).

You can download wxPerl sources from
$CPAN/authors/id/M/MB/MBARBON/Wx-0.18.tar.gz;

Screenshots: http://wxperl.sourceforge.net/sshot01.html
Binary packages for ActivePerl/Win32 6xx and 8xx builds, and Red Hat
Linux are available along with documentation in HTML and MS HTML Help
format from http://wxperl.sourceforge.net/download.html

The project home page is http://wxperl.sourceforge.net/. There is also
a mailing list dedicated to wxPerl users:
wxperl-users@lists.sourceforge.net

Changes since the last release:
	- Corrected handling of UTF-8 encoded strings in ANSI builds.
	- Added wxGridTableMessage.
	- Fixed build problems with GTK 2 and/or Unicode on
	  Unix hosts.

Regards
Mattia
