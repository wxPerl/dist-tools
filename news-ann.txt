Subject: [ANNOUNCE] wxPerl 0.19

A new version of wxPerl, the Perl bindings to wxWindows, is out!

wxWindows is a free and cross platform (Windows/Motif/GTK/Mac) C++ GUI
toolkit with native look and feel.  (visit http://www.wxwindows.org/
for details).

You can download wxPerl sources from

Linux are available along with documentation in HTML and MS HTML Help
format from http://wxperl.sourceforge.net/download.html

a mailing list dedicated to wxPerl users:
wxperl-users@lists.sourceforge.net
