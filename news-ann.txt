Subject: [ANNOUNCE] wxPerl 0.14

A new version of wxPerl, the Perl bindings to wxWindows, is out!

wxWindows is a free and cross platform (Windows/Motif/GTK/Mac) C++ GUI
toolkit with native look and feel.  (visit http://www.wxwindows.org/
for details).

You can download wxPerl sources from
$CPAN/authors/id/M/MB/MBARBON/Wx-0.14.tar.gz;

Binary packages for ActivePerl/Win32 6xx and 8xx builds, and Red Hat
Linux are available along with documentation in HTML and MS HTML Help
format from http://wxperl.sourceforge.net/

The project home page is http://wxperl.sourceforge.net/. There is also
a mailing list dedicated to wxPerl users:
wxperl-users@lists.sourceforge.net

Changes since the last version:
	- new DEPRECATIONS section in README.txt, please read it
	- Added Wx::DateTime (not the full interface).
	- Restored compatibility with perl 5.005.
	- Internal changes: objects returned by various constructors
          will not have an additional _WXTHIS key anymore.

Regards
Mattia
