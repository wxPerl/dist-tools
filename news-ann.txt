Subject: [ANNOUNCE] wxPerl 0.13

A new version of wxPerl, the Perl bindings to wxWindows, is out!

wxWindows is a free and cross platform (Windows/Motif/GTK/Mac) C++ GUI
toolkit with native look and feel.  (visit http://www.wxwindows.org/
for details).

You can download wxPerl sources from
$CPAN/authors/id/M/MB/MBARBON/Wx-0.13.tar.gz;

Binary packages for ActivePerl/Win32 6xx builds and Red Hat Linux are
available along with documentation in HTML and MS HTML Help format
from http://wxperl.sourceforge.net/

The project home page is http://wxperl.sourceforge.net/. There is also
a mailing list dedicated to wxPerl users:
wxperl-users@lists.sourceforge.net

Changes since the last version:
	- new DEPRECATIONS section in README.txt, please read it
	- New build system, allows building wxPerl extension written using
	  XS outside of the wxPerl tree.
	- Added Wx::Wave
	- Added Wx::MemoryFSHandler
	- Added Wx::Perl::Carp (thanks to podmaster).
	- Mac OS X support (requires wxWindows 2.4.0 or newer).
	- Added Wx::Socket* (thanks to Graciliano M. P.)

Mattia
