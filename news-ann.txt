Subject: [ANNOUNCE] wxPerl 0.21

A new version of wxPerl, the Perl bindings to wxWidgets, is out!

wxWidgets is a free and cross platform (Windows/Motif/GTK/Mac) C++ GUI
toolkit with native look and feel.  (visit http://www.wxwidgets.org/
for details).

You can download wxPerl sources from
$CPAN/authors/id/M/MB/MBARBON/Wx-0.21.tar.gz;

Screenshots: http://wxperl.sourceforge.net/sshot01.html
Binary packages for ActivePerl/Win32 6xx and 8xx builds, and Red Hat
Linux are available along with documentation in HTML and MS HTML Help
format from http://wxperl.sourceforge.net/download.html

The project home page is http://wxperl.sourceforge.net/. There is also
a mailing list dedicated to wxPerl users:
wxperl-users@lists.sourceforge.net

Changes since the last release:
	- Fixed installation of 'wxPerl' command on Mac OS X.
	- Fixed running in the embedded case (still requires the
	  application to call ExitMainLoop at the right places).
	- Wrapped wxNavigationKeyEvent.
	- Using die() in an event handler should not crash anymore
	  (it might leak).
	- Added Wx::PlWindow, to be used for custom controls.
	- New (Windows-only) --mslu flag for Makefile.PL.
	- Wx::NotebookSizer is now no longer needed and
	  deprecated.

Mattia
